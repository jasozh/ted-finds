to run preprocess_data do the following

ted_talks = pd.read_csv("talks_info.csv")
ted_talks['comments'] = ted_talks['youtube_video_code'].apply(func=get_video_comments)
ted_talks['comments'] = ted_talks.apply(custom_function, axis=1)

this should (might take a while tho) create the column comments of the form described in the function spec
note: might not work due to api key (lmk if that happens)
also: can look at the colab in our google drive titled preprocess_data
